This project was created with from the [serverless stack guide](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/who-is-this-guide-for.html) that helped teach me a lot about building a full stack serverless app. This was a very interesting topic/project, and something I look forward to digging into deeper. 

I added a little bit extra styling to the project and included the ability to add tags to your notes. You can filter the notes by clicking on a tag on one of the notes or by selecting one or more tags in the search window. 

### Issues:
The search function was somewhat challenging because I wanted the ability to continue to narrow the search as more tag filters were clicked and I didn't know much about how to do that. I experimented a lot and found a helpful post that led me to the use of every() and includes() methods.

The next issue was getting the tags displayed in each note on the home page to also act as a way of filtering. I tried and failed a lot of times with this one. I couldn't get the filter switch to switch on when a tag was clicked. I was setting the checked value to "checked" and thought that the onChange event would fire, but nope. Finally, I tried simulating a click with the click() method and it worked! It sounds so obvious, but I was stuck on changing the checked value. Sometimes a night or two of good sleep can be very helpful.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
